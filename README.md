## Overview

This project focuses on text analysis, using the TF-IDF. Our project is divided in three main parts   
**Part 1: Development of basic functions to analyse the speeches:**
- Extraction of president names 
- Association of each presidents with their names
- Text cleaning by converting the texts to lowercases and deleting punctuation
- Storing the clean texts in a `Cleaned` folder

**Part 2: Use of matrix to calculate similarities**
- TF-IDF matrix creation
- Display of least and most important TF-IDF words
- Display of the most repeated words by Jacques Chirac
- Display of the name of the president who repeated "nation" the most
- Display the name of the president who talked about climate first
- Display of the words every presidents said

**Part 3: Making of a menu for the user to use**

Menu options: 
-Type 1 to see our functions and then:
    - Extract President's First Name (`Type 1`)
    - List of President's Last Names (`Type 2`)
    - Clean and remove punctuation from speeches (`Type 3`)
    - Display the TF-IDF matrix (`Type 4`)
    - Display least important words in the corpus (`Type 5`):
        - Shows words with TF-IDF = 0 in all files.
    - Display word(s) with the highest TF-IDF score (`Type 6`):
        - Shows word(s) with the highest TF-IDF scores.
    - Indicate most repeated word(s) by President Chirac (`Type 7`):
        - Shows the most repeated word(s) in speeches by President Chirac.
    - Indicate president(s) who spoke of 'Nation' and the one who repeated it the most (`Type 8`):
        - Identifies the president(s) mentioning 'Nation' and the one with the most repeated mentions.
    - Identify the first president to talk about 'climate' or 'ecology' (`Type 9`):
        - Determines the first president to discuss 'climate' or 'ecology.'
    - Show words mentioned by all presidents (except unimportant words) (`Type 10`):
        - Displays words mentioned by all presidents, excluding unimportant words.
    - Exit the program (`Type 0`)
        - Exits the program.
-Type 2 to ask a question
