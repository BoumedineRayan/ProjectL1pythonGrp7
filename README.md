## Overview

This project focuses on text analysis, using the TF-IDF. Our project is divided in three main parts   
**Part 1: Development of basic functions to analyse the speeches:**
- Extraction of president names 
- Association of each presidents with their names
- Text cleaning by converting the texts to lowercases and deleting punctuation
- Storing the clean texts in a `Cleaned` folder

**Part 2: Use of matrix to calculate similarities**
- TF-IDF matrix creation
- Display of least and most important TF-IDF words
- Display of the most repeated words by Jacques Chirac
- Display of the name of the president who repeated "nation" the most
- Display the name of the president who talked about climate first
- Display of the words every presidents said

**Part 3: Making of a menu for the user to use**

Menu options: 
- Display least important words in the corpus (`Type 1`):
    - Shows words with TF-IDF = 0 in all files.
- Display word(s) with the highest TF-IDF score (`Type 2`):
    - Shows word(s) with the highest TF-IDF scores.
- Indicate most repeated word(s) by President Chirac (`Type 3`):
    - Shows the most repeated word(s) in speeches by President Chirac.
- Indicate president(s) who spoke of 'Nation' and the one who repeated it the most (`Type 4`):
